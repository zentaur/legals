Hello ${new.committer.name},

The Zentaur Server Project team hereby offers you committer privileges to the project.

Being a committer enables you to more easily make changes without needing to go through the pull request process.

Being a committer does not require you to participate any more than you already do.
It does tend to make one even more committed. You will probably find that you spend more time here.

Of course, you can decline and instead remain as a contributor, participating as you do now.

If you intend accepting the invitation, please download the ICLA on https://github.com/zentaur/legals/blob/master/ICLA,
print, sign and send a scanned copy to Simone Tripodi (simone [dot] tripodi [at] gmail [dot] com)
or Christian Grobmeier (grobmeier [at] gmail [dot] com)

Have fun!
-${committer.name}, on behalf of the Zentaur Server team
